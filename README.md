<br>The Sustainable Computing Research Group (SCoRe) has conducted research covering various aspects of sensor networks, embeded systems, digital forensic, information security, mobile applications, cloud, blockchain and software tools.


## Overview

Currently, The SCoRelab Mobile App is in its initial stages where it gives us basic information about scorelab. When you visit different pages through the navbar you will see there are pages like - Home, Repositories, Website, Github, Contact, and Email. All the pages except Home and repositories are direct links. In the repositories section, you will see there are some of the main repositories by scorelab.

At present, the SCoRe group is at a stage of its evolution in which it has been able to secure high donor confidence as evidenced by simultaneous foreign-funded projects. The goal of our research is to generate computing solutions by identifying low-cost methodologies and strategies that lead to sustainability.

SCoRe group studies and produces sustainable computing solutions with respect to low-cost computing and communication foundations in the developing and emerging regions in the world. We have developed several affordable and sustainable ICT solutions especially focusing on the requirements in the developing region. These solutions are briefly described in the projects section.
