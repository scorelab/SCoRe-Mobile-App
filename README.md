The **Sustainable Computing Research Group** (SCoReLab) specializes in computing solutions through low cost methodologies and strategies in pursuit of sustainable solutions. With this, the group has conducted research covering various aspects of sensor networks, embedded systems, digital forensic, information security, mobile applications, cloud, blockchain and software tools. This is evident through several foreign funded projects.

## Description

To highlight the projects that have been completed or are undergoing development under SCoReLab, the SCoRe Mobile Application has been created.

The application allows the user to view a description of SCoReLab under the "About SCoreLab" tab.

Additionally, the user can browse projects such as Bassa, EtherBeat, or DroneSym through the "Repositories" tab. These cards with descriptions can be tapped on and will function as a direct link to these repositories.

Within the side navigation, the user is presented with the options: "Website", "Github", "Contact (Email)", and "Contact (Gitter)". All of these options function as direct links and do not have an associated view.
